        <h1>How To Do HTML</h1>
        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a programming language used to make websites like this one! If you want, you can right click anything and click "inspect" to see the HTML code. You can do this for fonts and if you like a design or something. That was just a tip, by the way.
        </p>
        <h2 class>How to code in HTML</h2>
        <p>In HTML, there are things called tags. A tag is something that starts with an angle bracket and ends with another angle bracket. In between is some information to tell each tag apart. For example: <span class="code">&lthtml&gt</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            First, we will go through the skeleton of HTML.
        </p>
        <ol id="skeleton">
            <li>
                <span class="code">&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt</span><br>
                This shows we are using a modern version of HTML, not an old, janky version.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code">&lthtml&gt</span><br>
                This signifies the start of the webpage.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code">&lthead&gt</span><br>
                This is the start of the head, which is where everything about the webpage is stored. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code">&ltmeta charset="utf-8"&gt</span><br>
                This tells the browser that the maker of the webpage only wants english, not complicated characters.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code">&lttitle&gtnew program&lt/title&gt</span> (programs may have different titles, so it doesn't have to be "new program")<br>
                It shows the title of the webpage.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code">&lt/head&gt</span><br>
                This shows the end of the head.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code">&ltbody&gt</span><br>
                This shows the start of the body of the webpage.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code">&lt/body&gt</span><br>
                This shows the end of the body of the webpage.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code">&lt/html&gt</span><br>
                This shows the end of the program.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Now that we know about the skeleton, let's continue to how to code.
        </p>
        <h3>Headings</h3>
        <p>
            In HTML, there are things called headings. There are six types of headings, from biggest to smallest:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <div class="code">
            <li>&lth1&gt
            <li>&lth2&gt
            <li>&lth3&gt
            <li>&lth4&gt
            <li>&lth5&gt
            <li>&lth6&gt
            </div>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Here, &lth1&gt is more important than &lth6&gt. Here are some examples:
        </p>
        <div id="Demo-headings">
            <h1>This is <span class="code">h1</span>.</h1>
            <h2>This is <span class="code">h2</span>.</h2>
            <h3>This is <span class="code">h3</span>.</h3>
            <h4>This is <span class="code">h4</span>.</h4>
            <h5>This is <span class="code">h5</span>.</h5>
            <h6>This is <span class="code">h6</span>.</h6>
        </div>
        <p>
            To make a heading, type <span class="code">&lt[h1 to h6]&gt</span>. Then, type in your heading. Finally, type <span class="code">&lt/[h1 to h6]&gt</span>. For example, <span class="code">&lth4&gtRabbits!&lt/h4&gt</span><br>If you type this in the body, you will get:
        </p>
        <h4>Rabbits!</h4>
        <p>
            So, if you want to show a heading, use <span class="code">&lt[h1 to h6]&gt[your heading]&lt[h1 to h6]&gt</span>!
        </p>
        <h3>Paragraphs</h3>
        <p>
            How often is it that you want to type or write a paragraph? Well, in HTML, there is a tag just for Just that reason: the <span class="code">&ltp&gt</span> tag!
        </p>
        <p>
            To type in a paragraph, you must type <span class="code">&ltp&gt</span>, then your paragraph, then <span class="code">&lt/p&gt</span>. For example, <span class="code">&ltp&gtThey told her that this was her once chance to show the world what she was made of. She believed them at the time. It was the big stage and she knew the world would be there to see. The only one who had disagreed with this sentiment was her brother. He had told her that you don't show the world what you're made of when they are all watching, you show that in your actions when nobody was looking. It was looking more and more like her brother was correct.&lt/p&gt</span>(Huge thanks to the person who made the random paragraph generator which is called https://randomwordgenerator.com/paragraph.php that was so useful!) Anyways, if you type this between the two body tags, you will get this:
        </p>
        <p>
            They told her that this was her once chance to show the world what she was made of. She believed them at the time. It was the big stage and she knew the world would be there to see. The only one who had disagreed with this sentiment was her brother. He had told her that you don't show the world what you're made of when they are all watching, you show that in your actions when nobody was looking. It was looking more and more like her brother was correct.
        </p>
        <h3>Lists</h3>
        <p>
            Have you ever made a list? Maybe of groceries, best dog faces, or a wishlist? Well, this is what lists are for! they are made like this:
        </p>
        <h4>Ordered lists</h4>
        <p>
            <span class="code">
            &ltol&gt<br>
            &ltli&gt[Your first item]<br>
            &ltli&gt[Your second item]<br>
            &ltli&gt[Your third item]<br>
            </span>
            And so on, until you want to end your list.<br>
            <span class="code">
            &lt/ol&gt<br><br>
            </span>
            For example,<br><br>
            <span class="code">
            &ltol&gt<br>
            &ltli&gtMango<br>
            &ltli&gtOrange<br>
            &ltli&gtBanana<br>
            &lt/ol&gt<br><br>
            </span>
            And that makes:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Mango
            <li>Orange
            <li>Banana
        </ol>
        <h4>Unordered lists</h4>
        <p>
            This is just the same, but ul instead of ol. For example, it would look like:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mango
            <li>Orange
            <li>Banana
        </ul>
        <h3>Images</h3>
        <p>
            Ever seen an Image? Don't you want to make one in HTML? Well, this is how:
            
        </p>
        <p class="code">
            &ltimg&gt
        </p>
        <p>But, DO NOT add an end tag. I mean, do you store words in an image? No! This is why you should do this:</p>
        <p class="code">
            &ltimg src=""&gt
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, you must type in the image URL in the quotation marks.For example, after you type the image URL, it will look something like this:
        </p>
        <img src="https://www.kasandbox.org/programming-images/animals/rabbit.png" width="100%">
        <p>Well, this is a bit too big, so add:</p>
        <p>
            <span class="code">
                width="300"<br><br>
            </span>
            Now it will look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="https://www.kasandbox.org/programming-images/animals/rabbit.png" width="300">
        <p>
            Wow, much better!
        </p>
        <h3>Links</h3>
        <p>
            Have you ever seen a link? If you did, where did you see it? A webpage, of course! how, this is how to make one:
        </p>
        <p class="code">
            &lta href=""&gt
        </p>
        <p>
            Ok, stop there. I know you have few questions, let's answer them.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>What does the "a" stand for?<br>Answer: The "a" stands for anchor, because you anchor the website.</li>
            <li>What is "href"?<br>Answer: "href" means hyper refrence, which is just a fancy word for link.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Okay, now type in the link in the quotation marks. For example:
        </p>
        <p class="code">
            &lta href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/"&gt
        </p>
        <p>
            Well now, there's an error. You need an end to the a tag! Do it like this:
        </p>
        <p class="code">
            &lta href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/"&gt&lt/a&gt
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, type in what you want the link to look like between the two a tags. For example:
        </p>
        <p class="code">
            &lta href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/"&gtHTML&lt/a&gt
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, click the blue "HTML" below this sentence.<br><br><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">HTML</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            So, did you see the w3shools HTML tutorial? Great!
